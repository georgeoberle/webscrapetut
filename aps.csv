						Wistar Association"
"65","Composed originally of eight members of the APS, the Wistar Association was organized in 1818 to continue the agreeable social entertainments which the Society's late President Caspar Wistar had held regularly for many years for members and distinguished visitors to the city. The Association suspended meetings during the Civil War, and did not meet after 1866. In 1884 the Fortnightly Club was formed for purposes similar to those of the old Wistar Association, although not all of its members were also members of the APS. When the Fortnightly sought to change its name to the Wistar Club, two ancient survivors of the older group revived the association, elected new members, and absorbed the upstart. In 1898, membership in APS was restored as a prerequisite for election. The Association has met regularly since 1886. Its membership is now over twenty, and modern transportation has made it feasible to include persons not residents of Philadelphia."

Bache, and Robley Dunglison) relative to publication of the papers, September 1,1841 (12 pages); the report of the committee which considered this paper and one by J.

The Association suspended meetings during the Civil War, and did not meet after 1866. In 1884 the Fortnightly Club was formed for purposes similar to those of the old Wistar Association, although not all of its members were also members of the APS. When the Fortnightly sought to change its name to the Wistar Club, two ancient survivors of the older group revived the association, elected new members, and absorbed the upstart. In 1898, membership in APS was restored as a prerequisite for election. The Association has met regularly since 1886. Its membership is now over twenty, and modern transportation has made it feasible to include persons not residents of Philadelphia."
